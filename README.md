# EDS 212 - Leslie matrix example

An example of population projection using the Leslie matrix. 

Example: A population of fish has four life stages: eggs (E), fry (F), juvenile (J), breeding adult (A). Each year: 

- Each breeding adult will produce, on average, 600 eggs
- 25% of eggs will survive to become fry
- 10% of fry will survive to become juveniles
- 40% of juveniles will survive to become breeding adults
- Adult survival rate year-to-year is 80%

In this code, we'll see the Leslie matrix (projection matrix), and project the population structure over several years using the dot product. Remember this - we'll learn for loops in EDS 221!
